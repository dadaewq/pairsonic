abstract: >-
  Securely exchanging contact information is essential for
  establishing trustworthy communication channels that
  facilitate effective online collaboration. However,
  current methods are neither user-friendly nor scalable for
  large groups of users. In response, we introduce
  PairSonic, a novel group pairing protocol that extends
  trust from physical encounters to online communication.
  PairSonic simplifies the pairing process by automating the
  tedious verification tasks of previous methods through an
  acoustic out-of-band channel using smartphones' built-in
  hardware. Our protocol not only facilitates connecting
  users for computer-supported collaboration, but also
  provides a more user-friendly and scalable solution to the
  authentication ceremonies currently used in end-to-end
  encrypted messengers like Signal or WhatsApp.
